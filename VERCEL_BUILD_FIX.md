# Vercel Build Fix - August 3

## 🚨 **Issue**
Vercel build was failing with:
```
Error: The pattern "api/**/*.js" defined in `functions` doesn't match any Serverless Functions inside the `api` directory.
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `vercel.json` file had a `functions` configuration that was looking for JavaScript files in an `api` directory, but this is a **frontend-only deployment**. The backend is hosted on Railway, so we don't need serverless functions in the frontend.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**
Removed the `functions` configuration from `frontend/vercel.json`:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [...],
  "headers": [...],
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.js": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [...],
  "headers": [...]
}
```

## 🧪 **Verification**
- ✅ Local build works: `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ Vite build generates proper dist files

## 🚀 **Expected Result**
Vercel deployment should now succeed without the functions pattern error.

## 📝 **Files Modified**
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Removed unnecessary `functions` configuration

## ✅ **Status: Ready for Deployment**
The build should now work correctly on Vercel.
