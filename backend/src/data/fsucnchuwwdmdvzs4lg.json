  "transcript": "then open. That's it. Any problems? The problem that you'll have when you do this is that sometimes when you hit this to do the screen, it just, you'll hear it right now, it just locked again because we're outside. So now we hit the screen. I'll hit the four, these numbers again. Now if I go too fast or I don't exactly hit the numbers right, it stays locked with all those numbers up there. So what does that mean? How do I reset it? I just have to keep hitting things until the screen finally goes blank with that red blink. The screen is then blank. So again, I'm starting from the beginning, four numbers. See, I didn't have to do any order and then the code again, and then we're back in.",
