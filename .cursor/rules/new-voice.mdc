ðŸ“Œ Cursor Summary (Current Plan)

Direct-to-S3 flow (init â†’ PUT â†’ complete) is the backbone.

DB required immediately: must store modules table with status, s3Key, transcript job, transcript text. This is the systemâ€™s source of truth.

FFmpeg normalization: uploadController enforces browser-safe MP4 (H.264/AAC).

AI Pipeline: uses aiPipeline.ts + aiService.ts to call Whisper (transcribe) + GPT (steps).

ModuleService: saves metadata + status updates into DB.

Frontend: UploadManager â†’ api.ts â†’ TrainingPage polls status & loads signed S3 video + steps.

Next step: enable DB, wire processing jobs into AssemblyAI (or OpenAI Whisper), and confirm the complete uploadâ†’AIâ†’training loop.
